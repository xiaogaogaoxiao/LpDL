This is an open source implementation for our work on complete dictionary learing.
The primary work is the UAI 2020 submission "Complete Dictionary Learning via  <i>ℓ</i><sub>p</sub>-norm Maximization'', Yifei Shen∗, Ye Xue∗, Jun Zhang, Khaled B. Letaief, Vincent Lau.  [pdf](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v124/shen20a/shen20a.pdf). The main theoretical results are summarized in this work
