# LpDL

This is an open-source implementation for our series work on  dictionary learning.


The primary work is the UAI 2020 submission "Complete Dictionary Learning via  <i>ℓ</i><sub>p</sub>-norm Maximization'', Yifei Shen∗, Ye Xue∗, Jun Zhang, Khaled B. Letaief, Vincent Lau.  [[pdf]](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v124/shen20a/shen20a.pdf) The main theoretical results are summarized in this work.

## 1.0 Prerequisites
+ **Matlab**


+ **MNIST Dataset**
MNIST data files
File format as specified on http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

## 2.0 Run the experiment for synthetic data
Run the Matlab files in the "Synthetic data" folder

## 3.0 Run the experiment for MNIST data
Run the Matlab files in the "lp-mnist" folder

## 4.0 Application for Blind Data Detection 
Run the code in the "L3_BlindDataDetection" folder, which provides the elementary code for algorithmic verification for the  paper "Blind Data Detection in Massive MIMO via ℓ3-norm Maximization over the Stiefel Manifold," Y. Xue, Y. Shen, V. Lau, J. Zhang and K. B. Letaief, in IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications.[[pdf]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9246702)
